# Python Snake Game üêç

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions‚Äî with screen wrapping for endless fun! This project is great for practicing game logic, event handling, and basic graphics in Python.

## Features
- **Smooth Movement:** Snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) with keyboard controls.
- **Collision Detection:** Checks for self-collision (game reset) and food collision (snake grows).
- **Screen Wrapping:** The snake wraps around the edges of the screen for a seamless experience.
- **Random Food Placement:** Food appears at random positions, ensuring it's within playable bounds.
- **Simple Graphics:** Uses Turtle for drawing the snake (yellow squares) and food (red circle) on a black background.
- **Game Loop:** Runs with a timed delay for fluid animation.
